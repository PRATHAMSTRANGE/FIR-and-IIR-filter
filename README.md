# Real-Time FIR & IIR Filter Implementation on ZedBoard FPGA

This project implements real-time **FIR** and **IIR** filters on a **ZedBoard (Zynq-7000)** FPGA. The system reads audio input from a **PMOD MIC**, processes it using digital filters with **configurable coefficients**, and outputs the filtered signal through a **PMOD DA2** DAC interface. Designed in Verilog and synthesized using Vivado, this project demonstrates practical signal processing on hardware.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Input**: PMOD MIC samples are digitized and fed into the filter module.
2. **Filtering**: Either FIR or IIR filter is selected. Coefficients can be preloaded or changed dynamically.
3. **Output**: The filtered output is serialized and sent to PMOD DA2 using a clocked interface (`SYNC`, `SCLK`, `SDATA`).
4. **Timing**: A clock divider ensures correct timing for DAC communication.

## 📊 Filter Comparison

Filter output was validated against MATLAB/NumPy implementations for accuracy. The hardware output closely follows software-generated signals, ensuring correctness and stability.
